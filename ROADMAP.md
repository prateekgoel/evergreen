# üå≤Evergreen Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

We'll try as much as possible to plan ahead.
The process for building something should try and follow:

* Add item to Roadmap
* Create a issue outline
* Create a PR, reference issue in PR
* Merge into master
* Move item from ROADMAP into CHANGELOG, and write any notes

#### Low scope docs in Storybook

The second part is to create the components that are required to build out documentation. A highlighted CodeBlock component, and maybe some useful helper components / utilities in a evergreen-docs package. I am thinking evergreen-docs will contain some Readme Markdown rendered of some sort.

#### Dedicated documentation website

The third part is to create documentation website, similar to how AtlasKit approaches this. This will require a bigger set of components and resources to be available.

#### Design documentation (long term goal)

The last part is to create design documentation. That will be primarily for designers, and is more focused around what is the right way to use a component or patter, instead of showing you how to implement it.
